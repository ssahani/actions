# üõ°Ô∏è Ubuntu Disk Encryptor for Tinkerbell Bare Metal Provisioning

## üìå Problem

The official [Image Builder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder) project **does not support LUKS encryption** for Ubuntu raw disk images by default. This is a critical limitation when provisioning **secure, encrypted bare metal systems** in cloud-native environments like [Tinkerbell](https://tinkerbell.org/).

Additionally, Tinkerbell's official actions like [`writefile`](https://github.com/tinkerbell/actions/tree/main/writefile) **do not support writing into LUKS-encrypted root partitions**, which means injecting configuration (e.g. `cloud-init`, SSH keys, Netplan) fails unless the volume is manually decrypted and mounted beforehand.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

To address this, we developed two components:

### üîê [`encrypt-ubuntu-image.sh`](https://github.com/ssahani/ubuntu-disk-encryptor/blob/main/encrypt-ubuntu-image.sh)

A standalone Bash script to convert an unencrypted Ubuntu 22.04+ raw disk image into a **LUKS2-encrypted** image with:

- ‚úÖ Encrypted root partition (`/`) using LUKS2
- ‚úÖ Unencrypted EFI and `/boot` partitions
- ‚úÖ Keyfile (`/boot/root_crypt.key`) stored in `/boot` and backed up to local disk
- ‚úÖ GRUB, initramfs, `fstab`, and `crypttab` updates in a chrooted environment
- ‚úÖ Root partition auto-resized (+2GB by default)
- ‚úÖ Full debug logging and safe error handling

> **Note**: The `/boot` partition contains the unlock key. Use TPM2, SecureBoot, or other physical security measures to protect it.

---

### üß© [`writefile` with LUKS Support](https://github.com/ssahani/actions/tree/main/writefile)

A custom `writefile` action for Tinkerbell that:

- ‚úÖ Unlocks the LUKS-encrypted root partition using `/boot/root_crypt.key`
- ‚úÖ Mounts the decrypted volume at `/mnt/root`
- ‚úÖ Writes arbitrary files (e.g., `cloud-init`, `netplan`, `authorized_keys`) into the mounted filesystem
- ‚úÖ Drop-in replacement for the original `writefile` action

---

## üß™ Use Case: Tinkerbell + EKS Anywhere

This toolchain is especially useful for provisioning **encrypted Ubuntu nodes** with [EKS Anywhere](https://anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/) using [Tinkerbell workflows](https://anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/docs/reference/tinkerbell/).

You can:

1. Stream a **LUKS-encrypted Ubuntu image**
2. Unlock the root partition via keyfile in `/boot`
3. Inject configuration (cloud-init, kubeadm, etc.)
4. Reboot into a **secure, Kubernetes-ready** node

---

## üì¶ Example Workflow Snippet

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: install-encrypted-ubuntu
    worker: '{{.device_1}}'
    actions:
      - name: image2disk
        image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/image2disk
        ...
      - name: unlock-and-configure
        image: quay.io/ssahani/writefile
        ...
      - name: reboot
        image: public.ecr.aws/tinkerbell-actions/reboot
```

# üîê chroot-luks-runner

A Go-based tool to unlock a LUKS-encrypted root partition, mount boot/root filesystems, and run user-defined commands inside a chrooted Linux environment. Ideal for provisioning, recovery, or cloud-init-like workflows.

## üöÄ Features

- Unlocks LUKS root partition using a keyfile
- Mounts boot and root partitions
- Sets up a minimal chroot with `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev/pts`
- Runs commands via configurable interpreter (e.g., `/bin/sh`, `/bin/bash`)
- Supports non-root execution using `sudo`
- Optional DNS (`resolv.conf`) support inside chroot

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

```bash
sudo BLOCK_DEVICE=/dev/sda3 \
     BOOT_DISK=/dev/sda2 \
     CMD_LINE="apt-get update; apt-get install -y nginx" \
     CHROOT=y \
     UPDATE_RESOLV_CONF=true \
     ./chroot-luks-runner
