writefile Tinkerbell Action

This container writes a file (e.g., a Netplan config) to a mounted, LUKS-encrypted root filesystem using a keyfile stored on an unencrypted boot partition.

It is designed to be used in Tinkerbell workflows for provisioning Ubuntu machines with encrypted root filesystems.

ðŸ”§ Purpose

This action:
	1.	Mounts the unencrypted boot partition (e.g., /dev/sda2).
	2.	Unlocks the LUKS root partition (e.g., /dev/sda3) using a keyfile stored in /boot/root_crypt.key.
	3.	Mounts the unlocked root filesystem.
	4.	Writes a file (such as Netplan config) to the mounted root filesystem with correct permissions and ownership.
	5.	Verifies that the file was correctly written.
